This game is based around a list of 500 actors  and who they have worked with. The aim of the game is for a given actor, a random actor is chosen and you must find the shortest path to the random actor. A graph is displayed of who the current actor has worked with.
The game 100% javascript so can be install directly onto a server without any installation

The list of actors and who they have worked with was generated by OpenAI. Note that OpenAI was trained on data before 2023 so may not be up to date. Also OpenAI sometimes gets it wrong such a not showing that Val Kilmer has worked with Billy Bob Thorton even thoug they worked together on Tombstone.

The images for each of these actors was generated by Grok. 

The game works by loading a degees.json file that lists 500 actors and who they have worked with alongside a blurb about each of the 500 actors. A random actor is chosen and a graph is generated using the javascript graphing package 'anychart'.
